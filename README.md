# quiz-form

# Homework - Due Monday 1/11 by 8pm
## Goal: Make a simple quiz form that the user can fill in and see how well they did.

1. Create a new “quiz-form” folder / GitHub Repo
1. Use Bootstrap to layout the page & form.
1. Use Vanilla JS / HTML5 to build the functionality
1. Ask 5 simple questions – you decide what the questions are 
 1. (ex: Q: what color is the sky? A: blue, Q: What animal says “oink”? A: pig, etc.)
1. If the user gets the answer correct, style the question positively
1. If the user gets the answer wrong, style the question negatively
1. Use custom CSS + Font Awesome icons to visualize the grading
1. Provide a button to grade the quiz
1. Provide a button to clear out all the answers the user filled in.
1. You need to use at least these JavaScript components: variables, arrays, “if/else” statements, and loops
1. Email me a link to the repo when you’re done.
